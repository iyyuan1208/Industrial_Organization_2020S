# Industrial_Organization_2020S

Files here contain three set of works completed for a economic course titled "Empirical Method of Industrial Organization" during spring of 2020.

## Project 1

Write functions that compute Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), Maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and Method of Moment (MOM) estimate.

## Project 2

Estimate a production function of labor and capital for the U.S. manufacturing industry from Manufacturing Industry Database (1997 NAICS version). Solve endogeneity problem by using fix effect, instrumental variable, and Olley and Pakes model.

## Project 3

Estimate a various number of system of demand for over the counter (OTC) pain medicine. They include single-product demand equation and Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) (lowest level, middle level, and high level). Use the preferred estimation technique to report the conditional and unconditional elasticities matrix.

## Project 4

Estimate a system of demand for home heating systems. Data contains individual-level data on California householdsâ€™ choices of heating systems, the installation cost and operating cost of each of the available systems, and some household demographic characteristics. 

Multinomial logit model of demand that include (A) installation cost and operating cost as product characteristics, (B) product fixed effects, (C) interactions between income and the two cost variables, (D) interactions between income and the product fixed effectS. Compare their results

A nested logit model grouping systems into nests based upon (A) whether they are powered by gas or electricity (heat pumps are electric), or (B)  whether they are a central air system or a room system. Compare their results.
